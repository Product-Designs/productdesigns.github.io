## 🚀 Getting Started

This is a static website built with [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with live reload:

```bash
npm run start
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## 🎮 Gamified Design Showcase Examples

Three interactive examples applying open-world video game principles to design portfolio websites.

### Examples

1. **Visual Breadcrumb Trail** (`example1-breadcrumb-trail.html`) - Visual landmarks & peeking
2. **Discovery & Progress System** (`example2-discovery-progress.html`) - Achievements & collection
3. **Fog of War Reveal** (`example3-fog-reveal.html`) - Territory discovery

### Game Design Principles Applied

#### 1. Visual Breadcrumb Trail

**Open-World Principle: Visual Landmarks & Peeking**

Just like how games show distant mountains or towers that pull players forward, this design uses "peeking" cards that partially reveal the next design in the sequence.

**Key Features:**
- Cards scale down and shift to show what's coming next
- Pulsing navigation hint creates urgency to explore
- Progress dots at bottom provide spatial awareness
- Smooth scroll-snapping creates satisfying transitions

#### 2. Discovery & Progress System

**Open-World Principle: Achievements & Collection**

Inspired by collectibles in games like Zelda or Assassin's Creed, this system rewards thorough exploration with progress tracking, achievements, and category collections.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time XP and level-up system
- Achievement popups for milestones
- Category badge collection
- Visual progress bar with shimmer effect
- Checkmarks on viewed designs

#### 3. Fog of War Reveal

**Open-World Principle: Territory Discovery**

Borrowed from strategy games and exploration titles, designs start hidden under a "fog" that clears when clicked, revealing the content beneath.

**Key Features:**
- Mysterious fog overlay with animated drift
- Ripple and sparkle effects on reveal
- Counter tracking revealed regions
- Completion celebration when all areas explored

### How to Use

Open any HTML file directly in your browser - no build step required. Each example is self-contained.

### Core Principles

What makes open-world games compelling and how they apply to design showcases:

- **Visual Pull** → Breadcrumb trail showing next designs
- **Progress Tracking** → XP bars, counters, completion percentages
- **Rewards** → Achievements, unlocked badges, celebrations
- **Multiple Goals** → View all designs, collect all categories
- **Mystery** → Fog of war hiding content
- **Spatial Awareness** → Progress indicators, navigation hints
- **Satisfying Feedback** → Animations, sparkles, ripples, notifications
